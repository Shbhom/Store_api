## Authentication and Authorization

To access most of the routes, you need to be authenticated with a valid token. The token is obtained during registration or login and should be included in the headers of your requests as shown in the Authentication section.

The `verifyUser` middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes. If the token is invalid or not provided, the middleware will return a 401 Unauthorized error, prompting the user to log in again.

Please note that some routes may require additional permissions (e.g., admin access) for certain actions.
